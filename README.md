<h1>SmallBusinessNetwork</h1>
This project implements a small network, similar to that which may be found in a small business environment.  Using topics learned in lecture and through outside research, we implemented a such a network consisted of multiple subnets, a DMZ hosting an HTTP server and a Secure subnet hosting business critical services including DNS, authentication, and database services.  We configured a Cisco infrastructure running NAT, DHCP, and access control lists to handle security.  We were able to implement the network using lab computer running virtual machines and networking equipment from the lab.  As an added bonus we setup second small network to simulate the untrusted Internet and to test the configuration of our access control lists.  The following documents our steps in configuring the network, explains issues that arose during the configuration, and demonstrates the finished projects using screen shots and other examples.
